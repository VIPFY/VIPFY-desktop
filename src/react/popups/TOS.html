            the person has received the confirmation of the creation of the Account and necessary credentials from Supplier in order
            to log in to his/her/its Account; or
        </li>
        <li>
            for those Pipedrive Services and parts of the Web Site the use of which is not dependent on creating an Account, upon the

    </ol>
    <p>You may not, without Supplier’s prior written consent, access the Pipedrive Services (i) for production purposes, (ii)

    <p>Once accepted, these Terms remain effective until terminated as provided for herein.
    </p>
    <h4>3. Modifications to Terms</h4>
    <p>Supplier reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove portions of the Terms at any time
        by posting such changes on or through the Platform or the Pipedrive Services. Please check these Terms periodically
        for changes. Your continued use of the Pipedrive Services after such changes have been posted as provided above constitutes
        your binding acceptance of such changes. Such amended Terms will automatically be effective upon the earlier of (i)
        your continued use of the Pipedrive Services, or (ii) 30 days from posting of such modified Terms on or through the
        Platform. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the resolution of any dispute that arises between you and Supplier will
        be governed by the Terms in effect at the time such dispute arose.</p>
    <h4>4. Our Responsibilities</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>4.1. Provision of Pipedrive Services</strong>. Supplier will (a) make the Pipedrive Services, Content and Client
        Data available to a Client pursuant to these Terms, (b) provide applicable standard support for the Pipedrive Services
        to Client at no additional charge, and/or upgraded support (for an additional charge, if applicable), (c) use commercially
        reasonable efforts to make the Pipedrive Services available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, except for: (i) planned
        downtime (of which Supplier shall give advance electronic notice as provided in the Guidelines), and (ii) any unavailability
        caused by circumstances beyond Supplier’s reasonable control, including, for example, an act of God, act of government,
        flood, fire, earthquake, civil unrest, act of terror, strike or other labor problem, Internet service provider failure
        or delay, or denial of service attack.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>4.2. Protection of Client Data</strong>. Supplier will maintain administrative, physical, and technical safeguards
        for protection of the security, confidentiality and integrity of Client Data, as described in the Guidelines. Those
        safeguards will include, but will not be limited to, measures for preventing access, use, modification or disclosure
        of Client Data by Supplier personnel except (a) to provide the Pipedrive Services and prevent or address service
        or technical problems, (b) as compelled by law in accordance with Section 7.4 (Compelled Disclosure) below, or (c)
        as a Client or User expressly permit in writing.</p>
    <p>The Services may be performed using equipment or facilities located in the&nbsp;European Union or the United States.
        The Supplier’s US service providers are either Privacy Shield compliant or have executed Standard Contractual Clauses
        (as approved by the European Commission) that provide legal grounds for assuring that, when processed in the United
        States, the personal data of EU citizens that are processed by Pipedrive customers when using the Pipedrive Service
        will receive from the Supplier and its service providers located outside the EU an adequate level of protection within
        the meaning of Article 46 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation).</p>
    <p>By agreeing to these Terms, the Client grants the Supplier a general authorization in the meaning of Article 28 (2) of
        Regulation (EU) 2016/679 to engage processors for the purposes of providing the Pipedrive Services. The Supplier
        will inform the Client of changes in such processors in accordance with the procedure of modifying these Terms as
        stipulated in section 3 of these Terms.</p>

    <h4>5. Using the Pipedrive Services</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>5.1 Establishing an Account</strong>. Certain features, functions, parts or elements of the Pipedrive Services can
        be used or accessed only by holders of an Account. The person who wishes to create an Account must:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>complete the sign-up form on the Web Site or alternative process provided by a Reseller if access to the Pipedrive
            Services is purchased from a Reseller; and</li>
        <li>accept these Terms by clicking “Sign up” or other similar button</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Each Client may have only one Account. If several persons need to use an Account on behalf of Client, Client must designate
        such persons as Users. Each such User shall be subject to the restrictions set forth in these Terms.
    </p>
    <p>If Client has designated Users and granted them Authorization, such Users will be deemed to be authorized to act on behalf
        of Client when using the Account. Supplier is not responsible for and shall have no liability for verifying the validity
        of Authorization of any User. However, Supplier may,&nbsp;in its discretion, request additional information or proof
        of the person’s credentials.&nbsp;If Supplier is not certain if a User has been granted Authorization, Supplier may,
        in its sole discretion, prevent such User from accessing the Pipedrive Services.</p>
    <p>A User may be associated with multiple Clients and Accounts. Deleting a User from one Account will not remove the User
        from the Platform if he/she is connected to multiple Accounts.
    </p>
    <p>The Client and any User associated with an Account must provide Supplier with true, accurate, current, and complete information
        about the Client, Users or Account and keep it up to date.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>5.2 Logging Into an Account</strong>. Supplier shall provide Client with a username and password (“Login Credentials”)
        to be used to log in to its Account unless the Client uses the single sign-on feature or another service to log in.
        These Login Credentials must not be used by multiple persons. If Client has designated several Users, each User will
        be provided with separate Login Credentials. Client and each User are responsible for keeping confidential all login
        credentials associated with an Account. Client must promptly notify Supplier:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>of any disclosure, loss or unauthorized use of any Login Credentials;</li>
        <li>of a User’s departure from the Client’s organization;</li>
        <li>of a change in a User’s role in the Client’s organization;</li>
        <li>of any termination of a User’s right for any reason.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <strong>5.3 Termination of Account</strong>. Client may terminate these Terms at any time as provided in Section 17. Supplier
        shall permanently delete the Account within six months of the effective date of the termination.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>5.4 Fees.</strong> The use of an Account is subject to a Fee. Upon sign-up for an Account, the Client must select
        a Plan. Different rates apply to different Plans. The applicable Fee is charged in advance on monthly or annual payment
        intervals, unless agreed otherwise between parties. All Fees are non-refundable, i.e. there are no refunds or credits
        for periods where the Client did not use an activated Account, used it only partially, or deactivated the Account
        or terminated these Terms during an ongoing payment interval. If, after signing up, Client elects to upgrade to a
        more expensive Plan, the unused portion of any prepaid Fees shall be applied to the Fee of the more expensive Plan.</p>
    <p>All Fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies or duties applicable under any applicable law, unless stated otherwise stated
        herein. Client is solely responsible for the payment of such taxes, levies or duties.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>5.5 Changing Plans</strong>. Any Client has the right to upgrade or downgrade a current Plan at any time by selecting
        a new Plan among the collection of Plans determined by the Supplier. In such an event, the Client’s credit card on
        file with the Supplier will automatically be charged with a Fee for the next payment interval with the rate stipulated
        in the new Plan.</p>
    <p>Downgrading of the current Plan may cause the loss of features or capacity of the Account, as well as the loss of Client
        Data.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>5.6 Free Trial.</strong> A new Client may be entitled to a Free Trial, unless the Client has applied for the Account
        as a result of an ongoing marketing campaign organized by the Supplier in co-operation with its partners. The Client
        is not required to provide any credit card information during the period of Free Trial. If the period of Free Trial
        has expired, the Account will be automatically deactivated. In order to prevent deactivation or to reactivate the
        Account, the Client is required to select a suitable Plan and pay the first Fee. If the Client does not pay the first
        Fee within 2 weeks as of the expiry of the Free Trial, Supplier has the right to permanently delete the Account,
        including all Client Data therein.</p>
    <p>In addition to the current collection of Plans, Supplier may offer special discounts and motivation schemes (for example
        finder’s fees, etc.).</p>
    <h4>6. Payment</h4>
    <p>The following provisions are applicable only if you purchase access to the Pipedrive Services directly from Supplier.
        &nbsp;If you purchase access to the Pipedrive Services through a Reseller, the payment terms are set forth in the
        agreement with your Reseller.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>6.1 Credit Card Authorization</strong>. Supplier may seek pre-authorization of Client’s credit card account prior
        to your purchase of Pipedrive Services in order to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds
        or credit available to cover your purchase. You authorize such credit card account to pay any amounts described herein,
        and authorize Supplier to charge all sums described in these Terms to such credit card account. You agree to provide
        Supplier updated information regarding your credit card account upon Supplier’s request and any time the information
        earlier provided is no longer valid.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>6.2 Electronic Invoice</strong>. If Supplier has not sought pre-authorization of your credit card, then before the
        end of each payment interval, Client will be issued an electronic invoice for payment of the Fee of the next payment
        interval. Client must pay the invoice by the due date indicated on the invoice.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>6.3 Overage Charges.</strong> Upon delay with any payments, Supplier may require the Client to pay interest on the
        delay (penalty for late payment) for the period as of the time the payment obligation falls due until conforming
        performance is rendered. The interest rate of penalty for late payment due 1) if Pipedrive EU is the Supplier, shall
        be the interest rate specified in §113 of the Law of Obligations Act of Estonia; 2) if Pipedrive UK is the Supplier,
        shall be 4% a year above the Bank of England’s base rate from time to time, but at 4% a year for any period when
        that base rate is below 0%; 3) if Pipedrive US is the Supplier, shall be 1% per month; provided, however, if any
        interest paid to Pipedrive US is determined to be in excess of the then legal maximum rate, then that portion of
        each interest payment representing an amount in excess of the then legal maximum rate shall be deemed a payment of
        amounts owing under Section 6.2. Upon calculation of the penalty for late payment, one year shall be deemed to contain
        365 calendar days.</p>
    <h4>7. Client data</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>7.1 Uploading Client Data to Platform</strong>. If the Client uploads Client Data to the Platform, such Client Data
        and any processing of such Client Data must be in compliance with these Terms and applicable law. All rights, title
        and interest in and to the Client Data belong to the Client or third persons (including Users, persons and Organizations)
        whether posted and/or uploaded by you or made available on or through the Pipedrive Services by Supplier. By uploading
        Client Data to the Platform, Client authorizes Supplier to process the Client Data. The Client is responsible for
        ensuring that:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>the Client and any of the Users associated with the Account do not create, transmit, display or make otherwise available
            any Client Data that violates the terms of these Terms, the rights of Supplier, other Clients or Users, persons
            or Organizations or is harmful (for example viruses, worms, malware and other destructive codes), offensive,
            threatening, abusive, harassing, tortuous, defamatory, vulgar, obscene, invasive of another’s privacy, defamatory,
            hateful or otherwise unlawful; and</li>
        <li>the Client and all of the Users associated with the Account have the necessary rights to use the Client Data, including
            to insert it into the Platform and process it by means of the Account.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <strong>7.2 No Guarantee of Accuracy</strong>. Supplier does not guarantee any accuracy with respect to any information contained
        in any Client Data, and strongly recommends that you think carefully about what you transmit, submit or post to or
        through the Pipedrive Services. You understand that all information contained in Client Data is the sole responsibility
        of the person from whom such Client Data originated. This means that Client, and not Supplier, is entirely responsible
        for all Client Data that is uploaded, posted, transmitted, or otherwise made available through the Pipedrive Services,
        as well as for any actions taken by the Suppliers or other Clients or Users as a result of such Client Data.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>7.3 Unlawful Client Data</strong>. Supplier is not obliged to pre-screen, monitor or filter any Client Data or acts
        of its processing by the Client in order to discover any unlawful nature therein. However, if such unlawful Client
        Data or the action of its unlawful processing is discovered or brought to the attention of Supplier or if there is
        reason to believe that certain Client Data is unlawful, Supplier has the right to:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>notify the Client of such unlawful Client Data;</li>
        <li>deny its publication on the Web Site or its insertion to the System;</li>
        <li>demand that the Client bring the unlawful Client Data into compliance with these Terms and applicable law;</li>
        <li>temporarily or permanently remove the unlawful Client Data from the Web Site or Account, restrict access to it or
            delete it.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If Supplier is presented convincing evidence that the Client Data is not unlawful, Supplier may, at its sole discretion,
        restore such Client Data, which was removed from the Web Site or Account or access to which was restricted.
    </p>
    <p>In addition, in the event Supplier believes in its sole discretion Client Data violates applicable laws, rules or regulations
        or these Terms, Supplier may (but has no obligation), to remove such Client Data at any time with or without notice.</p>
    <p>Without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, Pipedrive US complies with the Digital Millennium Copyright
        Act, and will remove Client Data from the Platform upon receipt of a compliant takedown notice.</p>
    <p>Pipedrive EU as the data processor will assist the Client as the data controller in meeting the Client’s obligations
        under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, providing subject access, and allowing data subjects to exercise their rights under
        Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
        <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>7.4 Compelled Disclosure</strong>. Supplier may disclose a Client’s confidential information to the extent compelled
        by law to do so. In such instance, Supplier will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Client with prior
        notice of the compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and Client shall provide reasonable assistance,
        at its cost, if Client wishes to contest the disclosure. If Supplier is compelled by law to disclose Client’s confidential
        information as part of a civil proceeding to which Supplier is a party, and Client is not contesting the disclosure,
        Client will reimburse Supplier for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to that confidential
        information.
    </p>
    <h4>8. Services</h4>

        <strong>8.1 Use of the Pipedrive Services</strong>. Subject to these Terms, and the payment of the applicable service Fee,

        the contacts set forth below as soon as reasonably possible. Responding to enquiries of Clients and Users who have
        accepted these Terms but do not have an Account may be less expedient, or may not occur at all. </p>

    <ol>

        support will be provided by the Reseller and not by the Supplier.
        <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>8.3 Modifications to Service</strong>. Supplier reserves the right to modify the Pipedrive Services or any part or
        element thereof from time to time without prior notice, including, without limitation:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>rebranding the Pipedrive Services at its sole discretion;</li>

            temporarily or permanently;</li>
        <li>taking such action as is necessary to preserve Supplier’s rights upon any use of the Pipedrive Services that may
            be reasonably interpreted as violation of Supplier’s intellectual property rights, distribution of Internet viruses,
            worms, Trojan horses, malware, and other destructive activities or illegal activity.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>As applicable, Client may be notified of such modifications when logging in to the Account. Modifications, including
        change in applicable rates for the Pipedrive Services, will become effective thirty (30) days before the effective
        date of such modification.</p>

        access to the Pipedrive Services from a Reseller) before the effective date of the modification, and these Terms
        will terminate on the effective date of the modification. The Client’s continued use of the Pipedrive Services, or
        any part or element thereof, after the effective date of a modification shall indicate its consent to the modifications.
        Supplier shall not be liable to the Client or to any third person for any modification, suspension or discontinuance
        of the Pipedrive Services, or any part or element thereof.</p>
    <h4>9. Data Processing Contract</h4>

        to process the data as described in these Terms.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>9.1 Subject matter and nature of processing.</strong> The Supplier provides the Platform where the Client, as the
        data controller, can collect, store and organize the personal data of data subjects determined by the Client. The
        Platform has been designed to work as a sales CRM tool but, to the extent not regulated by these Terms, the Client

        Client Data, unless instructed otherwise by the Client. The Supplier deletes or returns all the personal data to
        the controller after the end of the provision of services relating to processing, and deletes existing copies unless
        Union or Member State law requires storage of the personal data.</p>

        in sections 4 through 10 of these Terms. The Supplier ensures that persons authorised to process the personal data

        The Supplier takes all measures required pursuant to Article 32 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679. The Supplier undertakes
        to make available to the controller all information necessary to demonstrate compliance with their obligations and
        to allow for and contribute to audits, including inspections, conducted or mandated by the Client as the data controller.</p>

        <strong>17.4 Remedies</strong>.</p>
    <p>If Supplier terminates these Terms as a result of an uncured breach by a Client or User, Supplier is entitled to use
        the same or similar remedies against any other persons who use the Pipedrive Services in conflict with these Terms.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, Supplier may also apply any other remedies available to it under the applicable law.
        Upon application of any remedies, the Client or User may lose Access or suffer a loss of certain features, functions,
        parts or elements of the Pipedrive Services.</p>
    <p>If Supplier has reasonable grounds to believe that the Client’s or User’s use of the Pipedrive Services, including the
        Account may harm any third persons, Supplier has the right to take adequate measures under its control to prevent,
        stop and eliminate the harm, where possible, in order to protect those third persons.</p>
    <h4>18. Who You Are Contracting With</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>18.1 General</strong>. The Supplier with whom Client is contracting depends on the domicile of the Client. The Supplier
        determines the domicile of the Client based on the country indicated in the billing address of the User who concludes
        these Terms on behalf of the Client. During the Free Trial, the Supplier determines the domicile of the Client based
        on the location indicated in the IP-address of the User who concludes these Terms on behalf of the Client. By accepting
        these Terms, the Client is contracting with the Supplier listed opposite such Client’s domicile in the following
        table.

    <p>For Clients domiciled in the United States, any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter of these Terms
        shall be finally settled by arbitration in New York, New York, using the English language in accordance with the
        Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience
        in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, who shall be selected from the appropriate list
        of JAMS arbitrators in accordance with the Arbitration Rules and Procedures of JAMS. The prevailing party in the
        arbitration shall be entitled to receive reimbursement of its reasonable expenses (including reasonable attorneys’
        fees, expert witness fees and all other expenses) incurred in connection therewith. Judgment upon the award so rendered
        may be entered in a court having jurisdiction or application may be made to such court for judicial acceptance of
        any award and an order of enforcement, as the case may be. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall have the
        right to institute an action in a court of proper jurisdiction for injunctive or other equitable relief pending a
        final decision by the arbitrator. For all purposes of these Terms, the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction
        and venue in the United States Federal Courts located in New York, New York. Use of the Pipedrive Services is not
        authorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms, including without limitation,
        this section.</p>
    <p>We each agree that we shall bring any dispute against the other in our respective individual capacities and not as a
        plaintiff or class member in any purported class, representative proceeding or as an association. In addition, we
        each agree that disputes shall be arbitrated only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative
        action. The arbitrator does not have the power to vary these provisions.</p>
    <p>For Clients domiciled in the United Kingdom, all disputes arising out of or in connection with the present Terms, including
        any question regarding its existence, validity or termination, shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration
        of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) (the “Arbitration Rules”) by one (1) arbitrator with substantial
        experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes, appointed in accordance with the
        said Arbitration Rules. &nbsp;The place of the arbitration shall be London (England). The language of the arbitration
        shall be English. The arbitration shall be commenced by a request for arbitration by the either party (the “Claimant”),
        delivered to the other party (the “Respondent”). The request for arbitration shall set out the nature of the claim(s)
        and the relief requested. Except as otherwise specifically limited in these Terms, the arbitral tribunal shall have
        the power to grant any remedy or relief that it deems appropriate, whether provisional or final, including but not
        limited to conservatory relief and injunctive relief, and any such measures ordered by the arbitral tribunal shall,
        to the extent permitted by applicable law, be deemed to be a final award on the subject matter of the measures and
        shall be enforceable as such. &nbsp;Each party retains the right to apply to any court of competent jurisdiction
        for interim and/or conservatory measures, including pre-arbitral attachments or injunctions, and any such request
        shall not be deemed incompatible with the agreement to arbitrate or a waiver of the right to arbitrate. The existence
        and content of the arbitral proceedings and any rulings or awards shall be keep confidential by the parties and members
        of the arbitral tribunal except (i) to the extent that disclosure may be required of a party to fulfil a legal duty,
        protect or pursue a legal right, or enforce or challenge an award in bona fide legal proceedings before a state court
        or other judicial authority, (ii) with the consent of all parties, (iii) where needed for the preparation or presentation
        of a claim or defense in this arbitration, (iv) where such information is already in the public domain other than
        as a result of a breach of this clause, or (v) by order of the arbitral tribunal upon application of a party. &nbsp;The
        arbitral tribunal may include in its award an allocation to any party of such costs and expenses, including lawyers’
        fees, as the arbitral tribunal shall deem reasonable. Any award of the arbitral tribunal shall be final and binding
        on the parties. Enforcement of any award may be sought in any court of competent jurisdiction.
        <br>
    </p>
    <p>If any part of this provision is ruled to be unenforceable, then the balance of this provision shall remain in full effect
        and construed and enforced as if the portion ruled unenforceable were not contained herein.</p>
    <p>Use of the Pipedrive Services is not authorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these
        Terms, including without limitation, this section.
        <br>
    </p>
    <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, you and the Suppliers agree that nothing herein shall be deemed to waive, preclude, or
        otherwise limit either party’s right to (i) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal, state, or local
        agencies where such actions are available, (ii) seek injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iii) to file suit in
        a court of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.</p>
    <h4>19. General Provisions</h4>
    <p>
        <strong>19.1 Relationship of the Parties</strong>. The parties will act solely as independent contractors. These Terms shall
        not be construed as creating an agency, partnership, joint venture, fiduciary duty, or any other form of legal association
        between the Client and either Supplier, and the Client shall not represent to the contrary, whether expressly, by
        implication, appearance or otherwise. These Terms are not for the benefit of any third parties.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>19.2 Severability</strong>. If any term, condition or provision of these Terms is held to be invalid, unenforceable
        or illegal in whole or in part for any reason, that provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible
        so as to effect the intent of the parties. The validity and enforceability of the remaining terms, conditions or
        provisions, or portions of them, shall not be affected.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            <strong>19.3 Entire Agreement</strong>.</strong> These Terms are the entire agreement between Client and Supplier regarding
        Client’s use of the Pipedrive Services and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, proposals or representations,
        written or oral, concerning its subject matter. Except as otherwise provided herein, no modification, amendment,
        or waiver of any provision of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by the party against whom
        the modification, amendment or waiver is to be asserted.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>19.4 Assignment</strong>. Client may not, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by operation of law or otherwise,
        assign or transfer these Terms or delegate any of its rights and/or obligations under these Terms without Supplier’s
        prior written consent. Any attempted assignment, transfer or delegation without such prior written consent will be
        void and unenforceable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Client, or its permitted successive assignees or transferees,
        may assign or transfer these Terms or delegate any rights or obligations hereunder without consent: (1) to any entity
        controlled by, or under common control with the Client, or its permitted successive assignees or transferees; or
        (2) in connection with a merger, reorganization, transfer, sale of assets or product lines, or change of control
        or ownership of the Client, or its permitted successive assignees or transferees.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>19.5 No Waiver</strong>. Failure of either Party to exercise or enforce any provision of or any of its rights under
        these Terms shall not be deemed a waiver of future enforcement of that or any other provision or right.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>19.6 Notices</strong>. Except as otherwise specified in these Terms, all notices related to these Terms will be in
        writing and will be effective upon (a) personal delivery, (b) the second business day after mailing, or (c), except
        for notices of termination or an indemnifiable claim (“Legal Notices”), which shall clearly be identifiable as Legal
        Notices, the day of sending by email. Billing-related notices to you will be addressed to the relevant billing contact
        designated by you. All other notices to you will be addressed to the relevant Services system administrator designated
        by you.</p>
